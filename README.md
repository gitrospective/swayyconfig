# swayyconfig
A sway config to get you started

## Motive
Suppose you have installed sway for the first time, wouldn't it be helpful if you had pre-made config file which sets you up with a basic config? Most users use the i3 config, but certain scripts and tools that work in i3 do not work well with sway. This config file is to kickstart your sway journey with a few configs and some really helpful scripts.

## Installation

Type this command in to your shell
```
git clone https://github.com/gitrospective/swayyconfig ~/.config/sway/
```
